Planning for changing coastlines is becoming increasingly crucial given the impending risk of global sea level rise caused by climate change. With more than 70% of the world's coastlines now modified in some shape or form by humans, we need to know how to mitigate potential damage to our urban landscapes caused by gradual sea level rise and flash flooding events. The model we are attempting to create would allow any user to visualize sea level rise in a given area under multiple Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) levels defined by the IPCC. Indeed, the speed at which global sea levels will rise depends on our society's ability to mitigate climate warming (decreasing greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning to renewable energies, etc). Scientist have therefore created a prediction model to assess the effects, whether they be negative or positive, of our global dedication to mitigating climate change. In this way, RCP 8.5 is widely accepted as the equivalent of "business as usual" with barely any efforts to mitigate climate change, with global temperatures increasing by up to 3 or more degrees Celsius by 2099, hence leading to higher sea levels by 2099. On the other hand, RCP 2.5 would be the equivalent of a future with high mitigative efforts from the global population, leading to a strong decrease in GHG emissions and significantly mitigating sea level rise as a result. The lower the RCP number, the higher our mitigative efforts would be. Our model would therefore offer four different visualisations; one for each of the widely used RCP scenarios (2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5).
